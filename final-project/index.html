          Good. White background makes text easily readable.

          There is a lot of text on the pages, which actually might make it overwhelming for some users.

          Easy to use for people who can see. Would be difficult for people with vision problems.

            The site doesn't do well on the validators. The images don't have alt text and some of the tags are switched around. It seems that the thumbnail images should be links, but are not setup correctly. Some of the suggestions from the validators probably aren't as useful, such as "The type attribute is unnecessary for JavaScript resources."

            Tabbing would be difficult on the site. One could take many of the quizzes and navigate the content, but it would probably be impossible for a user to create an account. Some of the quizzes would also be difficult to take. Sometimes, the tab gets stuck so that it can't access any content. This definitely needs improvement.

            The search box doesn't contain a label. I wonder if there is a workaround to save space. To an extent, the search box says "Search" within the text of the input, so this is fairly clear. Overall, I think that the input boxes function well.

            One of the positive functionalities is that the site doesn't contain excessive advertising. Many 
            other content sites will include popups, dozens of ads, and data tracking cookies. Some sites have 
            so many ads that it will often cause a browser to crash. This isn't the case with Jetpunk. We have received numerous offers for auto-playing video and audio ads, and many other annoying advertisements that likely pay more money. However, we turn down these offers.

            Functionality is pretty good on mobile, although the nature of the site makes it a little tougher on mobile, especially because it's more difficult to type on a phone. About 28% of the traffic comes from mobile, which is an increase from previous years. However, mobile traffic consists of a significantly lower percentage of traffic than on our other sites.
